scn DDzzFnScribe2

;After quite a few tiring experiences with the syntax and use of Scribe within the OBSE compiler, I've made a temporary more user-friendly version of it.

string_var sString
string_var sLogName

begin _Function { sLogName sString }
RegisterLog $sLogName
Scribe $sString+"|"+$sLogName
end
